    <p><strong>Observation Summary:</strong></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Subject self reports as [[Maya &amp; Sadie + Amber</td>
      <td>Maya]], a Paolumu Researcher sent to the Coral Highlands three weeks ago.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Subject’s “relaxed” form presents a distinct, “wyvern-taur” configuration, wherein her upper torso has adopted Paolumu-like characteristics, including white fur, large ears, and claws, and is attached at the waist to the neck of a relatively-large, but otherwise normal Paolumu. Notably, the heads and elongated necks of the two Paolumu specimens she fused with extend from the back of her head, and display a degree of independent movement. Subject reports little-to-no control over the two, likening them more to Canynes on leashes.</p>

<p>Maya, similar to all previous subjects, exhibits anomalous physical capabilities tied to elder dragons and the crystalline deposits within the Elder’s Recess (See [[New World Phenomena Report 5 - “Dragon Energy”]]). Exposure to small quantities of this energy allows for voluntary and significant alteration of the subject’s physical form, allowing the subject a wide range of sizes and shapes. However, excessive exposure results in a breakdown of this control, leading to rapid, uncontrolled mutation manifesting as the spontaneous growth of various body parts. Any further study would need to be heavily supervised, as it is speculated that an uncontrolled environment could cause runaway mutations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings &amp; Implications:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Subject Maya represents an exceptional case of Aberration, demonstrating a unique dual-Paolumu fusion and remarkable shape-shifting abilities tied to Dragon Energy.</li>
  <li>Her altered state has provided invaluable, first-hand insights into Paolumu biology and behavior, facilitating unprecedented close-range observation.</li>
  <li>Initial reaction to the fusion involved significant distress and a period of isolation, highlighting the psychological impact of Aberration events. Intervention by another Aberration (Subject [[Elara]]) proved crucial in the subject’s acclimation and retrieval by the Guild.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>

<p>Further study of subject is strongly recommended due to her unique physiological and behavioral characteristics. Her controlled shape-shifting ability may offer insights into the mechanisms of Aberration transformations and the influence of Dragon Energy, and prove invaluable for practical applications in expeditions. Continued observation of her interactions with other Aberrations may also yield valuable data on inter-species dynamics within this new phenomenon.</p>
