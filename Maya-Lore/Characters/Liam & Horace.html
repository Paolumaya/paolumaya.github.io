<h3 id="aka-aberration-specimen-1">AKA [[Aberration]] Specimen #1</h3>
<p>First known guild member to report being affected by the energy blast caused by Xeno’jiiva.
Discovered 3 hours after the defeat of Xeno’jiiva</p>

<p>Liam was on a routine Jagras population control hunt in the Ancient Forest. A Research team reported an abnormally high population. Upon entry, an Anjanath was found to have broken into the Jagras nest and culled a majority of the overflowing population.
After consulting his handler and contacting Astera, the Anjanath was assigned as a new target, as the number of Jagras it had killed could quickly go beyond reason.
Liam mounted an Anjanath and saw a blinding blue flash. Upon regaining consciousness, his human torso was sticking out of the Anjanath’s forehead, and the Anjanath retained full sentience, even elevated to sapience. The two shared a strong mental bond, with the Anjanath absorbing an understanding of language from Liam, and naming himself Horace, which he viewed as “dignified” despite how silly it is.
The two made their way towards Astera, trying to get someone’s attention. When they finally did, the Commander ordered a full-scale investigation into the two, and sent an urgent communique to the 3rd Fleet’s Satellite Base for any possible assistance. The 3rd Fleet Base’s response came in the form of 2 additional Aberrations, [[Theodore]] and [[Elara]], both of whom were discovered soon after Liam.</p>

<p>Liam has a full telepathic link with the Anjanath, who has used this mental connection to gain a substantial understanding of the Guild, and to name himself Horace.
The pair have a substantial amount of control over their size. Horace is able to shrink down to near-human size (232.05 cm), or grow to over twice his initial recorded length of 1633.89 cm. The pair has also been shown to increase the size of individual body parts, such as Horace’s arms, tail, and legs, to aid in both combat and utility.
They mostly patrol Astera’s border with the Ancient Forest, and to help with transportation and hauling of supplies to local camps. Also commonly sent as a bodyguard for more dangerous expeditions.
Of note: his torso did not take on any Anjanath traits.</p>
