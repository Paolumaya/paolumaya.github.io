Discovered 4 hours after the defeat of Xeno'jiiva

Merged with a female Legiana, fully assimilating her mind into his.

Haughty and self-centered, even before becoming fused with an apex. 

Does not care for any of the other Aberrations, but not [[Elara]] or [[Maya & Sadie + Amber|Maya]], as they're both 'beneath him'. Despite this, he is also deeply jealous of Maya's unique Aberration + Abomination powers.
