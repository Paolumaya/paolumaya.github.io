    <p>A fusion of two or more monsters. The most noticeable Abominations are between two different species, but are most commonly fusions within the same species.</p>

<p>Abominations are also much more common than Aberrations, though this is also because human/monster contact is far more rare.</p>

<h3 id="intra-species-abominations">Intra-species Abominations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extremely common, and usually similar to the standard variations of their species.
    <ul>
      <li>The commonly visible outward signs of an Abomination are extra parts, including but not limited to heads, legs, and tails. These are not necessarily universal in a base state.</li>
      <li>Exposure to Dragon Energy sources often cause them to form.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Usually otherwise indistinguishable from normal members of a species.
    <ul>
      <li>Gender-specific behaviors in intersex (male+female) fusions can cause confused actions, but usually these are fairly easy for the new being to correct over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inter-species-abominations">Inter-species Abominations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Relatively uncommon, though extremely obvious in nearly all cases.</li>
  <li>Almost never a clean/stable mix.
    <ul>
      <li>Specimens are often seen shifting and changing between the parts of both monsters.</li>
      <li>Stress is known to accelerate this process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Very often feral and out-of-control. Also extremely strong, usually above tempered monsters of the same species.
    <ul>
      <li>Slaying has been necessary in all cases, as sedation has little effect on them, similar to Elder Dragons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Dragon Energy causes them to shift even more erratically and become EXTREMELY aggressive. Overexposure has been known to cause organ failure and in one case (a Bazelgeuse/Azure Rathalos Abomination) managed to obliterate itself by growing incomplete scales, which detonated on its hide.</li>
</ul>
