    <p>Setting: The New World: Astera, Coral Highlands, and the Elder’s Recess
Characters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maya
    <ul>
      <li>Monster researcher for the 5th Fleet, specializing in Paolumu. Adequate with a Hunting Horn or Bowgun, but not known for her hunting abilities. Panicky when out of her element, and easily flustered as a result.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Amber
    <ul>
      <li>Biologically male Paolumu displaying largely female behavior patterns (protective of nest, tending to eggs). He was so named because of his fascination with amber deposits before Maya could tell whether he was a biologically male or female.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sadie
    <ul>
      <li>Biologically female Paolumu displaying male behavior patterns (traditionally male mating display, being the primary aggressor in turf wars with other Paolumu, bringing back food, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Maya is a monster researcher who was on a multi-week expedition to the Coral Highlands, studying Paolumu behavior.</p>

<p>A report came from Astera that an crew of elite hunters had discovered the reason for the Elder Crossing and were investigating it.</p>

<p>Maya is a monster researcher who was on a multi-week expedition to the Coral Highlands, studying Paolumu behavior. A report from Astera that an crew of elite hunters had discovered the reason for the Elder Crossing and were investigating it.</p>

<p>Maya acknowledges it, but is far more focused on packing for her day out. The two Paolumu she’s been tracking for the last two weeks (who she has named Amber and Sadie) as they were displaying opposite gender roles from what was expected.</p>

<p>She set out from camp, trudging over to where S&amp;A were nesting, and quickly put on her ghillie mantle as she approached the nest.</p>

<p>She was appalled to see them both, collapsed in a heap, apparently from a Legiana attack. Amber had a massive gash across his neck from a beak, and Sadie’s wing was bent out of shape.</p>

<p>Cautiously, Maya approached the pair, putting her knowledge of the species to work as she tried to help the suffering Paolumu.</p>

<p>She did the best she could, but it was clear that both them were in rough shape, so she sat between them and rubbed their ears, something they barely had the energy to protest…</p>

<p>Until suddenly a flash of blue light filled her vision, both Paolumu squawked in her ears, a searing pain filled her body and she passed out…</p>
