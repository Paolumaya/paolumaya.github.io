    <p>The acrid scent of ozone and something indescribably <em>other</em> still hung heavy in the air, remnants of the wave that had pulsed outwards from the distant Elder’s Recess mere hours ago. Maya huddled deeper into the crevice of glowing coral, ignoring the dampness seeping into her research fatigues. Tears tracked clean paths through the grime on her cheeks.</p>

<p>She hadn’t meant to get so close. Field observation of Paolumu nesting habits required patience, distance, and a healthy respect for the Coral Highlands’ verticality. But then the screech had echoed – not the usual indignant puffing of a Paolumu, but the piercing cry of a Legiana. She’d arrived too late.</p>

<p>The clearing was a mess of scattered iridescent scales and deep gouges in the coral. Two Paolumu lay whimpering amidst the debris. One, the larger male she’d tentatively nicknamed ‘Sadie’ in her notes, had a deep, ragged tear along his inflatable neck sac, leaking air with pathetic hisses. The smaller female, ‘Amber,’ had one delicate wing membrane shredded, rendering her flightless. Both were bleeding, their usually pristine white fur matted crimson.</p>

<p>Maya’s detached researcher persona dissolved. These weren’t just subjects; they were creatures she’d watched for weeks, admiring their grumpy resilience and surprisingly tender interactions. She saw herself in them – soft exteriors hiding a vulnerability often exploited. Dropping her notebook, she approached cautiously, murmuring soothing nonsense. They didn’t flinch away, their dark eyes wide with pain and fear, recognizing her non-threatening presence.</p>

<p>She was tending to Amber’s wing, trying to assess the damage, when the second wave hit. It wasn’t like the first, distant pulse. This felt <em>immediate</em>, a pressure that slammed into her core, followed by an incandescent light that bleached the vibrant colours of the Highlands white. It wasn’t painful, not exactly, but it was <em>consuming</em>. Energy, raw and untamed, flooded the clearing, resonating with the faint bioenergy signature of the dying Xeno’jiiva clinging to the crystals around them.</p>

<p>Maya cried out, stumbling back, but the energy was already in her, <em>through</em> her. It arced between her and the injured Paolumu, drawn perhaps to their distress, their life force flickering weakly. For a heart-stopping moment, she felt an impossible connection – Sadie’s panicked pain, Amber’s terror, flooding her mind alongside her own fear.</p>

<p>Then came the <em>change</em>. It started as an agonizing, bone-deep <em>shift</em>. Her legs thickened, joints popping, muscles twisting and reshaping with terrifying speed. White fur, thick and soft, erupted across her skin, not just where her clothes were torn, but <em>everywhere</em> below her waist, consuming her human form. She felt her spine lengthen, her centre of gravity plummeting as a heavy, furred tail sprouted.</p>

<p>Worse, far worse, was the sensation at the back of her head. A sickening pressure, a splitting feeling, followed by <em>movement</em>. She didn’t dare look, didn’t dare comprehend the twin weights that suddenly lolled against her shoulders, the feeling of two other consciousnesses – terrified, confused, inextricably <em>part</em> of her now. Sadie and Amber weren’t just <em>connected</em> anymore. They were <em>her</em>. She was <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>Panic, primal and absolute, seized all three minds at once. Maya shrieked, a sound distorted by the sudden presence of Sadie and Amber’s own panicked cries echoing in her skull. She flailed, her new, immense lower body crashing clumsily against the coral. The two Paolumu heads writhed blindly, adding to the chaos. The combined terror was a feedback loop, amplifying itself until conscious thought dissolved into pure, instinctual flight.</p>

<p>When some semblance of control returned, Maya found herself deeper in the Highlands, wedged into a dense thicket of luminescent flora. The world swam. Her body felt alien, monstrously large and wrong. The constant, low thrum of Sadie and Amber’s fear resonated within her own chest. She could feel the dull ache from their pre-fusion injuries as if they were her own.</p>

<p>Looking down, she saw thick, white-furred Paolumu legs ending in clawed feet. Tentatively, she reached back, fingers brushing against soft fur, tracing the impossible curve of a long neck attached… to her. She snatched her hand back as if burned.</p>

<p>This was wrong. This was terrifying. She wasn’t human anymore. She was… this <em>thing</em>. A monster. What would the Commission do? Dissect her? Lock her away? The faces of her former friends, the ones who had turned on her, flashed in her mind. They would recoil in horror. Everyone would.</p>

<p>Fear, shame, and the overwhelming sensory input from three minds crammed into one body forced her deeper into hiding. She needed to understand, to process, but the sheer wrongness of her existence was paralyzing. The soft, fluffy creatures she had found solace in were now part of her monstrous form. She hid, not just from the world, but from herself, curled up in the glowing shadows of the Coral Highlands, praying for it to be a nightmare, praying for oblivion, while the terrified whimpers of Sadie and Amber echoed her own despair from the back of her mind. She stayed there for days, lost in a haze of fear and confusion, until Elara’s familiar call cut through the fog.</p>
