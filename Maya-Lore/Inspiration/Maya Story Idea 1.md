The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the makeshift research tent pitched near the Elder's Recess. Dust motes danced in the weak light, occasionally catching on the thick, pale fur that covered Maya's upper body. Her large, gentle eyes, now slightly more ovine in shape, darted nervously between the Guild Researcher, a stern-faced woman named Anya, and the two long necks that craned restlessly from the back of her head.

Sadie, the female Paolumu, kept trying to nudge Maya's ear with her snout, a soft, insistent huffing sound escaping her nostrils. Amber, the male, was more agitated, his gaze fixed on a nearby vein of pulsating blue crystal, a low growl rumbling in his chest. Maya gently stroked Sadie's snout with a large, furred hand, her fingers ending in rounded, paw-like nails.

"Thank you for your cooperation, Maya," Anya said, her voice crisp and professional as she adjusted her spectacles. "Your unique physiology has already provided invaluable data. Now, I have a few more questions regarding your transformations."

Maya shifted uncomfortably on the large, padded stool they had provided. Her lower body, a bulky, cream-colored Paolumu torso ending in powerful hind legs and a thick, fluffy tail that swished occasionally, took up a considerable amount of space.

"Of course, Anya," Maya replied, her voice a soft alto with a hint of a breathy quality, an inherited Paolumu vocalization. "Though, if you don't mind, the energy in here… it makes them a little jumpy." She gestured to Sadie and Amber, who were now both fixated on the crystalline walls of the recess visible through the tent flap.

"We'll try to be quick," Anya said, though her tone suggested otherwise. "Can you elaborate on the sensation you experience when you draw upon this 'Dragon Energy' to alter your form?"

Maya frowned, concentrating. "It's… a tingling, a warmth that starts deep inside. It feels like a potential, a vastness waiting to be shaped. When I focus, when I imagine the change, that energy flows outwards, almost like water filling a mold. It's not always precise, especially with more complex forms."

Suddenly, Amber let out a sharp cry, his long neck arching as he strained towards the tent flap. Sadie mirrored his agitation, a low whine escaping her. Maya placed a hand on each of their necks, her brow furrowed with concern.

"Easy, you two," she murmured, her voice soothing. "It's alright."

Anya tapped her pen impatiently on her notepad. "And the limitations? You mentioned being largely restricted to Paolumu parts. Have you ever attempted to manifest other monster features?"

Maya shook her head. "I've tried, in my mind. But it's like hitting a wall. The energy… it resists. It's as if my very being is fundamentally Paolumu now. The connection is strongest, the pathways are already there, I suppose."

As she spoke, the ambient Dragon Energy in the tent seemed to intensify, the faint blue glow emanating from the nearby crystals pulsing slightly. Sadie and Amber became increasingly frantic, their movements jerky and their soft vocalizations turning into distressed whimpers. Maya herself began to fidget, a sheen of sweat breaking out on her furred forehead.

"I… I don't feel so good," she stammered, her voice losing some of its steadiness. "It's getting… strong."

Anya, ever the dedicated researcher, leaned forward, her eyes gleaming with scientific interest. "Can you describe what you're feeling precisely?"

Before Maya could answer, a visible ripple seemed to pass through her fur. Her left hand, the one stroking Sadie, began to change. The rounded nails elongated, sharpening into distinct claws. The fur thickened and darkened slightly, taking on a more bristly texture. A small, leathery membrane began to stretch between her fingers, almost like a nascent wing.

Maya gasped, her eyes widening in alarm. "No, no, not now!"

Amber let out a panicked shriek and tried to bury his head in Maya's fur. Sadie, equally distressed, began to puff up her neck pouch slightly, a low, guttural rumble vibrating through Maya's back.

Then, the transformations accelerated. A small bulge appeared on Maya's right forearm, just below the elbow. It grew rapidly, the fur parting to reveal a patch of pale, stretched skin. Within seconds, the bulge elongated and hardened, a miniature Paolumu wing, complete with tiny claws, unfurling awkwardly.

Anya scribbled furiously in her notepad, her initial professional demeanor giving way to a wide-eyed fascination. "Incredible! Note the rapid cellular regeneration and… is that a secondary appendage forming?"

Maya was panting now, her breath coming in short, ragged gasps. Her face contorted in discomfort as another protrusion began to form, this time on her chest, just below her collarbone. It started as a small, hard lump, but within moments, it was pushing outwards, stretching the fur and skin. The shape became increasingly defined, and a collective gasp filled the tent – not from Maya, but from Anya's nearby assistant, who had been observing silently until now.

A long, pale snout, unmistakably Paolumu, was emerging from Maya's chest. It was slick with a clear fluid, and tiny, underdeveloped teeth were visible within its slightly open maw. The snout twitched, as if sensing the air.

"Subject is exhibiting… unprecedented polymorphic instability!" Anya exclaimed, her voice a mixture of awe and concern. "The Dragon Energy influx is clearly exceeding her threshold!"

But the most disturbing transformation was yet to come. A new bulge was forming on Maya's stomach, just above her Paolumu lower body. It grew with alarming speed, distorting her torso. The fur stretched taut, and then split, revealing raw, pink flesh. From the opening, a smaller, but perfectly formed, Paolumu snout began to emerge. It was pale and wrinkled, and a faint, wet snuffling sound could be heard.

Maya let out a choked sob, her hands flying to the grotesque protrusion on her stomach. "Stop… please… it hurts!"

Sadie and Amber were in a frenzy, their cries echoing in the small tent. Amber was trying to nuzzle the new snout on Maya's stomach, while Sadie frantically licked the sprouting wing on her arm.

Anya, finally recognizing the danger, took a step back. "We need to terminate the experiment! The energy levels are too high!"

But it was too late. The transformations were spiraling out of control. Small, furred bumps were appearing all over Maya's upper body, some elongating into rudimentary limbs, others forming miniature versions of Paolumu claws and teeth. Her face began to distort, her nose flattening and widening, her mouth stretching into a more pronounced snout.

The last coherent words Maya managed to utter were a choked plea. "Elara… help me…"

Then, the tent was filled with a cacophony of distressed Paolumu cries and the wet, squelching sounds of uncontrolled biological mutation as Maya's form continued to warp and shift under the overwhelming influence of the Dragon Energy. The Guild Researcher and her assistant could only watch in horrified fascination as the human-Paolumu Aberration dissolved into a nightmarish tapestry of fur, flesh, and sprouting snouts.
