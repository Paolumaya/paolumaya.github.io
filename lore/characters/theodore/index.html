<h1 id="theodore">Theodore</h1>

<p>Discovered 4 hours after the defeat of Xeno’jiiva</p>

<p>Merged with a female Legiana, fully assimilating her mind into his.</p>

<p>Haughty and self-centered, even before becoming fused with an apex.</p>

<p>Does not care for any of the other Aberrations, but not <a href="/lore/characters/elara/">Elara</a> or <a href="/lore/characters/maya-sadie-amber/">Maya</a>, as they’re both ‘beneath him’. Despite this, he is also deeply jealous of Maya’s unique Aberration + Abomination powers.</p>
