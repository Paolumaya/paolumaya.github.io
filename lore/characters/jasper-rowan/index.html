<p>Discovered 1 day after the defeat of Xeno’jiiva</p>

<p>Quick notes:
Jasper and Rowan’s bodies have become part of two separate small Girros and a Great Girros. 
As a result of this, the 3 bodies travel together, with each sibling piloting a small body, and sharing control of the large one.</p>

<p>All three bodies are still quadrupedal and unable to stand upright, but have forearms and hands that can be used to manipulate objects.</p>

<p>Exposure to dragon energy depends on the body exposed to it:</p>

<p>Minor exposures to the small Girros allows them to take a bipedal form temporarily, as well as increasing the amount of paralytic venom they secrete. Overexposure causes way too much paralytic venom to be produced, which has adverse effects on the short-term health of their bodies, generally dehydration and hunger.</p>

<p>Minor exposures to the Great Girros improves the pairs ability to share control over it and work together, though overexposure causes it to behave erratically due to extreme sensitivity to even the slightest thought.</p>
