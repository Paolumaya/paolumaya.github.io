A fusion of two or more monsters. The most noticeable Abominations are between two different species, but are most commonly fusions within the same species.

Abominations are also much more common than Aberrations, though this is also because human/monster contact is far more rare.

### Intra-species Abominations
- Extremely common, and usually similar to the standard variations of their species.
	- The commonly visible outward signs of an Abomination are extra parts, including but not limited to heads, legs, and tails. These are not necessarily universal in a base state.
	- Exposure to Dragon Energy sources often cause them to form.
- Usually otherwise indistinguishable from normal members of a species.
	- Gender-specific behaviors in intersex (male+female) fusions can cause confused actions, but usually these are fairly easy for the new being to correct over time.

### Inter-species Abominations
- Relatively uncommon, though extremely obvious in nearly all cases.
- Almost never a clean/stable mix.
	- Specimens are often seen shifting and changing between the parts of both monsters.
	- Stress is known to accelerate this process.
- Very often feral and out-of-control. Also extremely strong, usually above tempered monsters of the same species.
	- Slaying has been necessary in all cases, as sedation has little effect on them, similar to Elder Dragons.
- Dragon Energy causes them to shift even more erratically and become EXTREMELY aggressive. Overexposure has been known to cause organ failure and in one case (a Bazelgeuse/Azure Rathalos Abomination) managed to obliterate itself by growing incomplete scales, which detonated on its hide.
