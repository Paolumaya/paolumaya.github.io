<h2>Basic Protections Because Some Of Y'all Can't Behave</h2>
<h3>Unpunctual Art</h3>
If any of the following become true, I will request for you to refund my purchase:
<ul class="tos-list">
    <li>No sketch has been produced within four (4) months of payment</li>
    <li>No response to update requests after thirty (30) days</li>
    <li>Art remains unfinished one (1) calander year after payment</li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Refusing or otherwise being unable to do so will put you on my blacklist, along with an FA journal being created with
    a warning about your behavior.</b><br />
    Exceptions may be given if adequate explanation is offered, such as a long-term mental or physical illness.</h5>

</ul>

<h3>WIPs and Posting Rights</h3>
<ul>
<li class="tos-item">I prefer to have at least 1 WIP sent so that I can comment and ask for edits.<br>
<li>Refusing to send any WIP art means that, if I am unhappy with the completed artwork, you will not have my
    permission to post it anywhere.</li>
<li>If I find out that you have done so anyway, <b>I will put you on my blacklist.</b>
</li>
</ul>

<!-- <h1>The Do's and Don't's of drawing Maya!</h1>
<h2>Do!</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Do ask me questions/talk to me! I'd rather you ask me for my opinion on something than simply guess. <br />
        Guessing WILL usually lead to me asking for edits, or sometimes altogther disowning the work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Don't!</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Don't forget to add details like:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The stripe of fur on the nose</li>
        <li>The eye color</li>
        <li>The foot paws shape</li>
        <li>The tail</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Don't incorporate wing-arms. I will only ever have them if <i>EXPLICTLY AND SPECIFICALLY</i> requested.</li>
    <li>Don't </li>
